# Time Sum Calculator

This project consists of a simple web application designed to calculate the sum of times (hours, minutes, and seconds) entered by the user. It features a dynamic table where users can add times, and it automatically calculates the cumulative sum for each entry. This application serves as a practical tool for learning and testing various cloud services (like AWS EC2, AWS s3 for host static webpages, pipelines, etc.), as well as for educational purposes in web development and cloud computing.

## Getting Started

To utilize this application for learning or testing purposes, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local environment.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the downloaded files.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to launch the application.

## How It Works

The application provides a user-friendly interface consisting of a table with four columns: hour, minute, second, and sum. Users can add time entries in the respective hour, minute, and second fields. The application automatically calculates and displays the cumulative sum of the time entered in the 'Sum' column of the table. A button below the table allows users to add additional rows for more entries.

### Adding a Time Entry

- To add a time entry, fill in the hour, minute, and second fields in a row.
- The sum column updates to show the cumulative sum of all times entered above, plus the current row's time.
- To add more entries, click the "Add Row" button below the table.

## Files

- `index.html`: Contains the markup for the web application.
- `style.css`: Provides styling for the application, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.
- `script.js`: Contains the logic for adding rows, calculating time sums, and updating the table dynamically.
